# Heritage on the Marina Residents Portal Read Me


## [Heritage on the Marina Residents]( https://heretics-sf.github.io/residents/ )

This is a website for the residents of the Heritage on the Marina that is maintained by the Residents

The goal is a basic menu that is readable by the built-in web browser that comes with most e-readers that can be useful for finding useful information while preventing eyestrain.

The average website becomes ever-more complex and bloated, they often don't look so great on such a basic web browser. Sometimes they don't load at all.

This is a really simple website to share links to useful resources that load quickly and look good on very basic web browsers such as those that come with e-readers! This site is a project to which anyone may contribute - please submit websites via the link in the footer.
