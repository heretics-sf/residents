_A website for residents of the [Heritage on the Marina]( https://https://heritageonthemarina.org/ )_

## Introduction

This website for the residents of the Heritage on the Marina is maintained by the residents

The goal is to produce a basic website with a basic menu that is readable by the built-in web browser that comes with most e-readers that can be useful for finding useful information while preventing eyestrain.

The average website becomes ever-more complex and bloated, they often don't look so great on such a basic web browser. Sometimes they don't load at all.

This is a really simple website to share links to useful resources that load quickly and look good on very basic web browsers such as those that come with e-readers! This site is a project to which anyone may contribute - please submit websites via the link in the footer.
