What is a "Portal"? Oxford dictionary says the origin of the word is "late Middle English: from Old French, from medieval Latin portale, neuter (used as a noun) of portalis ‘like a gate’, from Latin porta ‘door, gate’"

In this spirit, a "Residents Portal" would be something that enables free communication both in and out.

Bernie, Margaret, Gardner and I - along with new member Tess Goldman - have had a meeting and several discussions. Also we have been discussed ideas with a number of residents.

in general (to my personal disappointment), there appears to be no urgent need for a resident actuated or driven website. Though nobody was against the idea, the typical response was "why?" or "what for?"

At the same time, the residents we talked to do have a number of valid communication needs.

A prime topic of conversation was better access to the TouchTown information as well as announcements in general.  The significant issues are:

* the time it takes to view the screen you want to see
* the length of screen visibility being too long for the slides you do not want to see and too short for what you do want to see.

A typical solution for these issues is to make the information available by email and SMS using a mailing list app as used by larger organizations
